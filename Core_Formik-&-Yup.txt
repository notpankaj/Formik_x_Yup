1. first we need Formik component from "formik";
    that component takes 
           a. initialValues
           b. validationSchema
           c. onSubmit  
           d. renders  the form with helper Prop
                  

    a. initialValues : are the default values of our form
    b. validationSchema : all the validation will be define here 
    c. onSubmit : will trigger when submitting form , its callback provides all the (form_values, helperFunctions) 
    d. helper Prop : contains data about form state , this can be used with onChange of <Form>

2. second we need Form component from "formik";
    this form will have a helper Prop contains data about form state 
    we can use it with onChange event to manage our form 

3. useField() Hook , for inputs
    we have to control our inputs , for this we can use useField(props) Hook
    this hook need all the atributes of input and returns const [field, meta] 
        a. field : holds the input data eg. values
        b. meta  : holds the input info eg. touched or error 
    this can be use to show error conditionally
